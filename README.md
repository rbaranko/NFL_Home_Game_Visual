# NFL_Home_Game_Visual

Data adapted from ESPN.com

The objective of the research project is to demonstrate visualization techniques to represent relationship between data points pertaining to home game statistics for NFL teams.  The project looks at game attendance and compares to how many home games a team wins. The goal of this project isn't to find a specific correlation or causation of the relationship as we already suspect they are highly correlated, however, it is to help visualize the relationship between points and detect out/underperformers.
